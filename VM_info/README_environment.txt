To run the website, one needs to create the MOFSimplify conda environment
Command to do this is: conda env create -f environment.yml

Then, activate the environment using: conda activate MOFSimplify

In addition, need to git clone two directories from the HJK group
https://github.com/hjkgrp/molSimplify and https://github.com/hjkgrp/AutomaticDesign

Then, add these two folders to the MOFSimplify conda path using: conda develop <directory>
Here, <directory> would be the path to a cloned git folder
